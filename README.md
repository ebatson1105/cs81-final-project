FINAL PROJECT README

===========================


My final project for the CS81 JavaScript programming class involves integrating some basic html, CSS styling, javascript code, and React form code, based on what I've learned this semester. While the features provided in my project for each of these categories are pretty rudimentary, it has been fun both learning about them, and working to try to integrate them together in a way so they will properly work. 

My project is a simple form submission, but is styled green, and consists of a React form popup message, greeting the user, prompting them to enter their name, email address, and favorite band in a form, with a submit button. Once the info is entered and submit is pressed, a javascript function will take the email address and add it to a mailing list database, and has been programmed to provide both a success or error message if the form submission succeeds or not. 


While relatively simple in design, it includes several of the concepts we've learned about in the semester thus far, and has been great practice for me to attempt to be creative, and take a topic I'm interested in (music) and find a way to integrate it with my project itself. If I were to continue working on this project later on, and obtained more skills in doing so, I would add more CSS inline styling to create a neater, cooler-looking webpage that is less plain, and would love to implement more in-depth javascript functions to do other things, such as create a bar graph breakdown of other's people's favorite bands, similar to a survey pol, or something similar. 

Overall, this has been a great time learning all of these skills, and I am very excited to continue my studies with other classes in CS moving forward. Thank you so much professor for the help, and for the very enjoyable and interesting class, which will no doubt help many people in their careers choices down the line!
